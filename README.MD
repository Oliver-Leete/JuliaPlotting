# DSC Data Processing and Plotting

I'd not reccomend using this, I'm only making it public to make it easier to reproduce my processing of DSC data for my PhD Thesis. It is just a small package with some functions for processing DSC data in the specific format that the DSC in the APSL lab exports CSVs in. I'm pretty sure that a lot of the code is dead code that isn't actually used anywhere, and the stuff that isn't dead code is still probably not well written.
